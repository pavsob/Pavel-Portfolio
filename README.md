## Autonomous Vehicles
### [ANGLERFISH NAVIGATION SYSTEM - navigation by mobile robots in unstructured spaces](https://github.com/pavsob/ANGLERFISH-NAVIGATION-SYSTEM---navigation-by-mobile-robots-in-unstructured-spaces)
*Dissertation Project - University of St Andrews*  
This dissertation project developed a novel navigational system called the Reverse anglerfish method for mobile robot navigation to plan a safe and efficient complete route to the goal.The system outperforms the conventional Potential field method by solving a local minima problem and is capable of overcoming obstacles of various complexity without the need for a global map. It can potentially be used not only for mobile robots, but also drones or multi-joint robotic arms.  
Tools used: Python, ROS (Robot Operating System), Rviz visualisation, Gazebo simulation, TurtleBot2

### [Search Coastguard Rescue Simulations](https://github.com/pavsob/Search-Coastguard-Rescue-Simulations)
Coastguard rescue simulation simulates the robot that has to navigate through the Giant's Causeway and find the shortest path to take people in danger to the safe position. Various search algorithms were implemented to optimize the robot's path to the goal.  
Tools used: Java
