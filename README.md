### [ANGLERFISH NAVIGATION SYSTEM - navigation by mobile robots in unstructured spaces](https://github.com/pavsob/ANGLERFISH-NAVIGATION-SYSTEM---navigation-by-mobile-robots-in-unstructured-spaces)
Dissertation Project - University of St Andrews
This dissertation project developed a novel approach called the Reverse anglerfish method for mobile robot navigation to plan a safe and efficient complete route to the goal.The system outperforms the conventional Potential field method by solving a local minima problem and is capable of overcoming obstacles of various complexity without the need for a global map. It can potentially be used not only for mobile robots, but also drones or multi-joint robotic arms.
