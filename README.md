Overview of the projects
## Autonomous Vehicles
### [ANGLERFISH NAVIGATION SYSTEM - navigation by mobile robots in unstructured spaces](https://github.com/pavsob/ANGLERFISH-NAVIGATION-SYSTEM---navigation-by-mobile-robots-in-unstructured-spaces)
*Dissertation Project - University of St Andrews*  
This dissertation project developed a novel navigational system called the Reverse anglerfish method for mobile robot navigation to plan a safe and efficient complete route to the goal.The system outperforms the conventional Potential field method by solving a local minima problem and is capable of overcoming obstacles of various complexity without the need for a global map. It can potentially be used not only for mobile robots, but also drones or multi-joint robotic arms.  
Tools used: Python, ROS (Robot Operating System), Rviz visualisation, Gazebo simulation, TurtleBot2

### [Coastguard Rescue Robot Simulation](https://github.com/pavsob/Search-Coastguard-Rescue-Simulations)
Coastguard rescue simulation simulates the robot that has to navigate through the Giant's Causeway and find the shortest path to take people in danger to the safe position. Various search algorithms were implemented to optimize the robot's path to the goal.  
Tools used: Java  
## Machine Learning
### [Automatic Medication Dispenser - Facial Recognition](https://github.com/pavsob/Automatic-Medication-Dispenser---Facial-Recognition)
Its purpose is to serve medicaments to the patients automatically. It consists of dispensing mechanism that picks an appropriate pill and dispenses it for a user. It has a screen through which the machine communicates with the patient. Another main component is a camera that the dispenser uses for facial recognition to identify the patient in front of the dispenser. It holds the database of its patients that contains data about the time the patient should be served the medications, what kind of medication and how many pills the patient should take. It also remembers whether the patient already took the pills. When the time comes to take the pill, the patient is notified by SMS.  
Tools used: Python, dlib, Arduino

### [Predicting Visual Data Competition](https://github.com/pavsob/Predicting-Visual-Data---Machine-Learning)
This code was used in a friendly machine learning competition for the best performance on a low-quality visual data set.
The task is to correctly identify the colour and texture of the objects from visual data based on other features. These data are histogram of oriented gradients, CIELAB colour space and oriented Gabor filters generated by the BIMP model. Support Vector Machine was used as the primary model.  
Tools used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

### [Maintenance of waterpoints - Neural Network](https://github.com/pavsob/Maintenance-of-waterpoints---Neural-Nets)
A neural network was built and trained to help improve the maintenance operations at waterpoints in Tanzania and make the water more accessible and clean.  
Tools used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

### [Credit card approval](https://github.com/pavsob/Credit-card-approval)
A simple logistic regression model that can predict credit card approvals.  
Tools used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

## Artificial Intelligence
### [Easy as ABC puzzle solver](https://github.com/pavsob/Easy-as-ABC-puzzle-solver)
Program that is capable of solving "Easy as ABC puzzle" by using propositional logic. In the first and second part the program is capable of checking the correctness of the puzzle and doing some deductions using procedual programming technique. In the third part the program encodes the problem into propositional logic, and then use the LogicNG library to use a SAT solver to solve the puzzles. Rules and the game itself can be accessed here: http://www.tectonicpuzzel.eu/easy-as-abc-puzzle%20techniques.html  
Tools used: Java, LogicNG library
### [Reasoning with Bayesian Networks](https://github.com/pavsob/Reasoning-with-Bayesian-Networks)
The alert system is constructed using Bayesian networks to reason with uncertainty in order to predict the risk of serious problems on the canal.  
Tools used: Java, AIspace Belief and Decision Networks tool
